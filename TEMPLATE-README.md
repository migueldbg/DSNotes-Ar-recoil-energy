# Determining the Recoil Energy in a Ar Detector
by Miguel Del Ben Galdiano

## Introduction
The goal of this note is to making a brief summary of the physics involved in the recoil energy deposited in a double phase 
noble gas scintillating detector such as the one used in the DarkSide-50 collaboration. More precisely, we wish to do preliminary
studies with regards to a liquid argon (LAr) detector.
