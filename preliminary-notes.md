# Overview of Detection Principles

 * Signature of the WIMP-atomic nuclei interaction: a nuclear recoil with energy in the keV range.
 * In dark matter direct detection experiments, two different backgrounds can be distinguished:
	* one resulting in electron recoils (due to gamma ray interactions) and
	* another resulting in **nuclear (atomic) recoils** in the VOI of the detector. These are the most dangerous, as the resulting signal are indistinguishable from those WIMPs would produce.
 * Due to their high spatial resolution, double-phase noble element detectors are capable of determining particle interaction sites in three dimensions. With this, one can achieve very effective fiducialization, crucial for background reduction.
 * Better discrimation efficiency between eletric and nuclear recoils can be achieved if, in addition to primary scinitillation, the ionization signal is also measured.

The workings of most dual phase noble detectors can be represented by the illustration below.
