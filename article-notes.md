	* *Section II, page 459:* the 128 mm scintillation photons are emmited from two nearly degenerate excimer states, a long-lived triplet state (1.5 microseconds) and a short-lived singlet-state (6 nanoseconds). The difference in ionization density between nuclear recoils and electron recoils produce different ratios of these states, resulting in a different time profile of the scintillation signal S1. More precisely, nuclear recoils have a grater fraction of singlet-states, such that they have a faster scintillation component when compared with electron recoils (this results in a higher f90 value).
